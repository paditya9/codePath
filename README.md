## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Some applications that intrigue me the most are:
1. Instagram:
 * Vanish mode
 * Custom background in chat
  
  c. Double tap to like
  
  d. Activity feed

3. Netflix:
   a. Preview of the movie while hovering
   b. Multiple user profiles
   c. Content carousels

4. Google Maps:
   a. Interactive maps
   b. Street/3D view
   c. Timeline bar
   d. Satellite view 

## Notes

Most intresting part was to understand the concept of how the colors are changing. Something I was stuck was to figure about what "StoryBoard" was and how I can integrate the UI with the logic. But at the end, I was able to figure it out and make it work smoothly
